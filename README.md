# Workday-Scheduler
A simple web application to help you jot down the tasks needed to be completed throughout the day.

## Description
This is a simple work day calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This application utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Day.js to handle date and time functionality.
The motivation behind this project was to create a planner that saves information based on the time of day. I used the typical 9-5 work schedule.
